## **1. Introduction to OCI Compute**  

### **1.1 What is OCI Compute?**  
OCI Compute provides on-demand, high-performance computing resources, including Virtual Machines (VMs) and Bare Metal (BM) servers. These resources are used to deploy and run applications in a cloud environment.

### **1.2 Types of Compute Instances**  
1. **Virtual Machines (VMs)**:  
   - Shared or dedicated compute resources  
   - Various shapes available (Standard, Dense I/O, GPU, etc.)  
   - Suitable for general applications, web hosting, and testing  

2. **Bare Metal Instances**:  
   - Dedicated physical servers  
   - No virtualization overhead  
   - Ideal for high-performance computing (HPC), big data, and large databases

**Steps to Create a Custom Image:**
1. Navigate to **Compute > Instances**.
2. Select the instance.
3. Click **Create Custom Image**.
4. Specify a name and compartment.
5. Click **Create Image**.

## **3.5 Security Best Practices for OCI Compute**  

1. **Use Security Groups & Firewalls**  
   - Limit inbound/outbound traffic using OCI **VCN Security Lists**.  
   - Restrict SSH (port 22) and RDP (port 3389) access.  

2. **Configure Identity & Access Management (IAM)**  
   - Grant **least privilege** access to users.  
   - Use **OCI Vault** for sensitive credentials.
